### Spotify top songs playlist generator
This simple script creates a spotify playlist populated with top 50 songs from your last 4 weeks, 6 months, all time.  

It's set up so that the first time you run it, it'll create the playlist, and then every time from then, it'll just update the playlist. Don't delete 
the txt file that is created. 

You can set the script as a cronjob so that it runs everyday or everyweek so that the playlist keeps updating automatically.
